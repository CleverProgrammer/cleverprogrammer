# The Joys of Probability
There are many questions that probability helps us answer:
1. How many possible 4-digit passcodes can you have on your iPhone 6?
2. How many centuries will it take to break a password with an entropy level of 77?
3. If you got heads on the first flip... What is the probability you will get heads again? (independent vs Dependent variables)

## So... Let's get started!
So let's start off with the iPhone 6 passcode question. How many possible ways of rearranging the 4 digit passcodes are there?
To answer that, we need to understand something important about probability. If we have some random **sequence** of some length (think of the 4 digit passcode) and we have a set of **outcomes** (think 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) we can use this information alone to get our answer. So let's start off with an easy example: If we were allowed to make a passcode with length of 1 (1 digit passcode instead of a 4 digit passcode), our passcode would would only have 10 possible ways of rearranging it --> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 
One cool thing to understand about probability is that
